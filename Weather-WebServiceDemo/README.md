The console app works and reads the weather forecast using either the REST protocol.
The weather data is provided by [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com). 
To use the Weather Undergroud API, you will need to obtain a key. A [free key](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) is avialable.

The Android project still needs to be finished.

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository.
To get the source code for this app you will need to
