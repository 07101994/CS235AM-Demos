__This app isn't finished yet!__
The console app works and reads the weather forecast using either the REST or SOAP protocols (or at leat it did in 2016).
The Android project still needs to be finished.

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository.
To get the source code for this app you will need to
clone or download the whole repository.

This demo was written for CS235AM, Android App Development, at Lane Community College.
