# ClickCounter-Code-XML
These apps demonstrate creating a simple UI in a single activity. There are two projects in this solution:

* ClickCounter-Code: The UI is created in C# code. The text on the UI widgets is defined using XML in Resources/Values.
* ClickCounter-XML: The UI is declared in XML. The text on the UI widgets is defined using XML in Resources/Values.


Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository. To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the whole repository.
