# CS235AM-Demos
Demo apps for the Android app dev course

Note: All these apps are in one repository, so you will
need to download or clone the whole repository even if you
only want code for one app.

##Directory

* Apps with multiple screens using Intent objects
  * AgeCalc
  * MathFlashCards
  * GuessMyNumber (not working yet)
* Apps that save activity state using OnSaveInstanceState
 * ToDo-SaveInstanceState, uses XmlSerializer to save and restore object state
