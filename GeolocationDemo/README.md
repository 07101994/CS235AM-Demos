This Xamarin solution contains two projects:
* FusedLocationProvider - Demonstrates getting location using the Google Play Services Fused Location Provider API
  * There is a walk-through of this code available in my blog post: [Using the Android Fused Location Provider](https://birdsbits.wordpress.com/2016/05/27/create-location-aware-android-apps/)
* XamarinGeolocator - Demonstrates getting location using the Xamarin cross-platform Geolocator plug-in
  

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository.
To get the source code for this app you will need to
clone or download the whole repository.

This demo was written for CS235AM, Android App Development, at Lane Community College.
