This Xamarin solution contains two versions of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It demonstrates loading layouts based on device orientation-- portrait or landscape. It contains projects for apps that have both linear and relative layouts:

* RpsDemo-LinearLayouts
* RpsDemo-RelativeLayouts

Note: This solution is just one solution in the course demo repository. To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the whole repository.

This code was written as an example for a course I teach at Lane Community College, 
CS235AM, Intermediate Mobile Applications Development: Android.
