This is an example of a Multi-screen app. The main concepts demonstrated are:
* Starting a new activity or resuming an existing activity using an intent
* Managing activity launch mode
* Sending information from one activity to another using an intent
* Using activity life-cycle events: onCreate, onResume, onNewIntent

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository. 
To get the source code for this app you will need to 
clone or download the whole repository.

This demo was written for CS235AM, Android App Development, at Lane Community College
