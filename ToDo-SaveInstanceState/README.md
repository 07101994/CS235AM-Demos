This is an example of an activity that doesn't loose it's state when it is destroyed and re-created. 

The main concepts demonstrated are:
*	Serializing and deserializing object state using the XmlSerializer class
*	Using the OnSavedInstanceState callback to store state in a Bundle object
*	Retrieving activity state in OnCreate
*	Using an EditText widget

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository. To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the whole repository.

This demo was written for CS235AM, Android App Development, at Lane Community College. Read more about the course here: https://birdsbits.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/xamarin-android-course
