This version of the Vocabulary Practice app uses Fragments. Note that the fragments are ListActivities, so the fragments have no .axml layout. This app demonstrates:

* Using the ListFragment class (as opposed to the ListActivity class)
* Specifying fragments in the .axml layout for the main activity
* Loading fragments differently based on screen size
	* 5 inch: fragments are loaded into different activities
	* 7 inch: fragments are loaded side-by-side in one activity

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository. To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the whole repository.

This demo was written for CS235AM, Android App Development, at Lane Community College.
