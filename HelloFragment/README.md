This app shows you how to use a Fragment. It's just a modification of the default click counter app. It only uses one fragment which is not very useful, but it makes it easy to see how the code works.


There are two versions of this app:
* HelloFragment - Has a statically loaded fragment. The fragment is specified in the Activity's layout.
* HelloDynamicFragment - The fragment is loaded programmatically instead of statically.

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository.
To get the source code for this app you will need to
clone or download the whole repository.

This demo was written for CS235AM, Android App Development, at Lane Community College.
