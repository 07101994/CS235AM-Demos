Fragments Walkthrough
=====================

This is the source code for the Xamarin [Fragment Walkthrough](http://docs.xamarin.com/android/tutorials/Fragments_Walkthrough). 

There are two projects included with this solution:

- `Honeycomb` is the project that deomonstrates the use of fragments on devices running Android 3.1 (Honeycomb) or higher.

- `SupportLibFragments` is the project that shows how to use fragments with a support package for devices running Android 1.6 (Donut) or higher.

----
This solution is a modified version of one provided by Xamarin in their [Monodroid-Samples](https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/FragmentsWalkthrough) Git repository.
The original solution was licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License]( http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The main change in this version is that it loads different UI layouts based on orientation rather than screen size.
